Co-designed from head to toe: towards end-to-end participatory design
=====================================================================



Participatory methodologies are now well established in social robotics to
generate blueprints of what robots should do to assist humans. The actual
implementation of these blueprints, however, remains a technical challenge for
us, roboticists, and the end-users are not usually involved at that stage.

In two recent studies, we have however shown that, under the right conditions,
robots can directly learn their behaviours from domain experts, replacing the
traditional heuristic-based robot controllers by autonomously learnt social
policies. We have derived from these studies a novel 'end-to-end' participatory
methodology called LEADOR, that I will introduce during the workshop.

I will also discuss the next steps for such an approach to be successfully
applied to more difficult assistive scenarios, like long-term deployments in
schools for autistic children.
